        <h1>Prototype</h1>
        <p>
          To prototype is to give form to a thought; to let an idea step into
          the world, even if it wobbles at first. Each iteration teaches us
          something new, guiding us closer to what it is meant to become. We
          follow curiosity wherever it leads, embracing the messy, magical
          process of turning imagination into reality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our community keeps us moving - a collection of curious minds, bold
          experiments, and shared “what ifs”. What you see today is the result
          of that collective rhythm: the urge to reimagine, to refine, to make
          something that feels alive.
        </p>
        <p>
          So welcome to Prototype - where ideas that have been brewing can
          finally bloom in full.
