          A good cup of coffee speaks of the collective effort and success of
          the many hands that went into delivering the coffee into your hands.
          From the farmers to the roasters to the baristas, they all play in
          part in preserving the coffee's character and form its story.
        </p> */}
        <p>Prototype coffee is a verb, not a noun.</p>

      <p>
        To prototype is to enter the flux of materializing ideas, unbound by
        expectation or result.

      <p>
        The cold brew you are holding has been steeped in collective critique
        and bottled with thoughtful experimentation. It reflects the taste of
        our small but growing community â€” have a sip and find yourself warmly
        welcomed in the process.
